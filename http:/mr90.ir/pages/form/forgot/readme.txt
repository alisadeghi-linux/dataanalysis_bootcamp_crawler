I decided to scrape mr90.ir which is a game website.
I want to compare some information of top 52 team in this game including name of each team with their profile url, when each team is created, the arrangement used by them and aslo what province they belong to and finally the last time that their administrator inspect them.
selenium python library is used.
the result data are saved in a csv file and then we can use from that to extract some data to have a perspective toward this fact that how top players care about their team.
